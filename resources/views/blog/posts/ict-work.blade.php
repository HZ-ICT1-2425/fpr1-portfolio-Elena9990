    <h3 id="ict-subheader">What are the most interesting companies for me?</h3>
    <p>
        So, I mentioned that I'd like to do diverse projects and improve them more and more. Yeah, I always wanted to
        create games and apps, but there's also something that I have always desired to do. And it is working in some of
        the biggest comapnies in the world. Why exactly those ones? Why not some companies connected with creating games
        and apps? Well, I'll give only one reason for now, because the rest is for you down below in the page. So, those
        comapnies use so much user's data and it's amazing how it all works for the companies and the users.

    <h3 id="ict-subheader">Facebook</h3>
    <p id="info-ict-para">
        Facebook is a social media and social networking service owned by American technology conglomerate Meta. Created
        in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew
        McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to
        American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other
        North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old, except in the
        case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years. As of December 2022, Facebook claimed almost 3
        billion monthly active users. As of October 2023, Facebook ranked as the third-most-visited website in the
        world, with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States. It was the most downloaded mobile app of
        the 2010s.

        Facebook has been a big part of my life, because I've had a profile there since I was a child and I've been so
        curious how everything in the app is just made. For instance, the fact that you can find so many poeple and see
        everything about them is quite interesting to see how it is done. The other reason that I would like to work in
        the company would be that it could give me a lot of marketing and coding experience. Another opportunity that I
        would add is that I can improve the system as well and be a part of that large team. Also, I'd like to see how all
        the information about all the users has been used and where exactly it goes.

    <h3 id="ict-subheader">YouTube</h3>
    <p id="info-ict-para">
        YouTube is an American online video sharing platform owned by Google. Accessible worldwide, YouTube was
        launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, three former employees of PayPal.
        Headquartered in San Bruno, California, United States, it is the second-most visited website in the world, after
        Google Search. In January 2024, YouTube had more than 2.7 billion monthly active users, who collectively watched
        more than one billion hours of videos every day. As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded to the platform at
        a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute, and as of 2021, there were approximately 14 billion
        videos in total.

        There are several reasons because of which I would like to work for YouTube. Firtly, it's been improving all the
        time and I as a user can say that it's always been intriguing to see the changes and actually think of a way to
        make some on my own. I would like to try to improve the desgin and to add more options to the platform. Also, I'd
        like to see the whole process "behind the scenes", for example, how they make the mecahcnism of approving the
        videos and how the regulations are being implemented.

        Joining Spotify as an IT specialist would be great not only because I would upgrade my coding skills, but also I
        would see some part of the music industry or at least in the technical part. Working there would give me the
        bigger perspective for working a completely deifferent technnical field which is great beacuse when you have more
        experinece with diverse apps like this one you can start combining all of your skills and make something greater
        as a product. Also, who isn't curoius about music in general? This is also a way to see new artist appearing in
        the music industry and having the opportunity to be part of the first ones who discovered them. And actually not
        only new artists but motivators who give motivational podcasts and help others to keep up with there success. So,
        that's how you start knowing more and more talents and some day you might even work with them, who knows?

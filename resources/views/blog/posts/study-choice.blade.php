        <h3 id="my-choice-header">How did it all start? </h3>
        <p>Everything started with me being curious about all the colorful stuff on the computers (games, sites,
            presentations, etc.). Since I was little, I've always wanted to create something interesting and big like a game,
            site or an app and that was one of the reasons for me to start thinking about what I should study. Then I decided
            to study in the IT class in my previous school, so there I did a lot of projects and I was so determined to make
            them interesting. All of my school work inspired me even more to continue with the subject of IT.

        <p>My decision for picking up the ICT program was taken, because of the knowledge given through it. With its power I
            can grow and develop in the IT sector pretty well and that means that the opportunities and the benefits from
            taking this particular program are large. Eventually, it gives the opportunity for the students to decide what
            their best side is – the technical or the business one. And this is a vital part of a student’s decision, because
            if it is not suitable for him, then he would have spent his time on something that is useless for him. So, this is
            a chance for me to see and decide what exactly from the three paths of the program (BIC, SE, DS) is most the
            relevant to take. In addition, the skills that I would get from the programs are very important for working in the
            IT market, for example, solving a client’s problem fast, well improved interaction with a team or clients,
            learning what is most needed on the market, expanding your creativity and ideas for new projects, applications and
            products. All of those would help me not only with taking the best job for me, but also with improving myself as a
            person and as a character.

            After completing the study I will have gained a lot of knowledge and skills which I will use in my future job or
            for my own projects which I will develop and make them useful for the rest of the world. Also, my future plans for
            a job aren't so specific, but I think I'll probably work something with UI/UX, game development or something like
            app development.
